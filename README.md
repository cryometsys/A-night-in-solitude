"A NIGHT IN SOLITUDE" is a text-driven game that was created as a undergrad project on OOP, focusing on classes and multiple files. This is the initial program. There will be future work(hopefully) on this project, expansion and additional features inclusion. For now, though, it is a small game with no interaction with the environment. You are able to only move from room to room; that option, too, limited by the program.
#How-to-play
At any room, you are provided some story and directions(Options being-> left, right, front, back). Depending on what the story tells you, you can move in on any of the directions. To do so, you simply have to type the first word of the direction on the console('L', 'R', 'F', 'B'). As you do, you will be redirected on that room. That is the idea, for now.
Hopefully you enjoy this little experiment. And thank you for checking it out.
